CS 360: Mobile Architect &amp; Programming


    Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
This app was designed as a means to track weight goals and progress. A user can insert a goal weight they are trying to achieve, and when they insert a weight entry that is below that goal weight, they will receive an SMS notification that they have accomplished their goal.
    
    What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
There is a login screen, a screen containing a table of weights where more entries can be inserted, and two screens for adding daily weights and a goal weight. Each screen was designed to have a very obvious and fluid flow, with thought placed on where buttons should be so the user wouldn't have to hold their device uncomfortably and could utilize it with one hand.
    
    How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
Strategies for coding the app included commenting unclear, complex blocks of code to give an overview of what it is trying to accomplish, which is vital for all large-scale projects. Code was also thought through and tested to make sure that functionality worked as the design intended.
    
    How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
Testing required running the app through emulators to ensure that the UI displayed properly and that buttons and data were being correctly recorded. This is an important process to prevent from releasing an app that is full of bugs and errors and crashes.
    
    Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I found using the layout editor to be difficult to use, so for the most part, I would create the widgets for the interface and then adjust them via code. There were also issues when it came time to adjusting the table in my app; I had to create another table for storing goal weights, and I was struggling to figure out why my app crashed whenever I would log in. I had to completely drop the table to get it to rebuild with the correct tables for storage. In the future, I plan to look into ways to implement functionality that will check for updates and update if the formats do not match.
    
    In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I believe that I was successful in creating a fluid interface. Visually, it needs some work, but I feel that it is very clear what the purpose of the app is from a quick look. Buttons are consistent and labeled plainly, and the screen reacts expectedly when touched.
